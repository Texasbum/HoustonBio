<p>Hi, Iâ€™m Houston â€” a conservation biologist, picture-taker, and perpetual wanderer of wild places. Iâ€™ve trapped foxes on a desert island in the Pacific, camped on mountain tops, and spent more time than Iâ€™d like to admit figuring out how to get my daily coffee in the backcountry.</p>

<p>My work blends collecting experiences, conserving the coolest species on the planet, and meeting people straight out of a work of fiction. Iâ€™m constantly in disbelief of what I experience in a regular workday, so I wanted to help connect others to the reality that is the living world.</p>
